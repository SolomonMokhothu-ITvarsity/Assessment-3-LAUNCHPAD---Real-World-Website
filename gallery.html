            <h2>ABOUT ALERT SYSTEMS</h2>
            <p1>The five-level COVID-19 alert system has been introduced to manage the gradual easing of the lockdown.
This risk-adjusted approach is guided by several criteria, including the level of infections and rate of transmission, the capacity of health facilities, the extent of the implementation of public health interventions and the economic and social impact of continued restrictions.
The country is on adjusted alert level 2 from 13 September 2021.
The country was on adjusted alert level 3 from 26 July to 12 September 2021.
The country was on adjusted alert level 4 from 28  June to 25 July 2021.
The country was on adjusted alert level 3 from 16 June to 27 June 2021.
The country was on adjusted alert level 4 from 16 June 2021.
The country was on adjusted alert level 2 from 31 May to 15 June 2021.
The country was on adjusted alert level 1 from 1 March to 30 May 2021.
The country was on adjusted alert level 3 from 29 December 2020 to 28 February 2021.
The country was on alert level 1 from 21 September to 28 December 2020.
The country was on alert level 2 from 00h01 on 18 August 2020.
The country was on alert level 3 from 1 June to 17 August 2020.
The country was on alert level 4 from 1 to 31 May 2020.
The country went into lockdown from midnight 26 March to 30 April 2020. (Alert level 5)
Criteria for determination of alert levels
Alert levels determine the level of restrictions to be applied during the national state of disaster.
(a) 'Alert Level 1' indicates a low Covid-19 spread with a high health system readiness;
(b) 'Alert Level 2' indicates a moderate Covid-19 spread with a high health system readiness;
(c) 'Alert Level 3' indicates a moderate Covid-19 spread with a moderate health system readiness;
(d) 'Alert Level 4' indicates a moderate to a high Covid-19 spread with a low to moderate health system readiness;
(e) 'Alert Level 5' indicates a high Covid-19 spread with a low health system readiness.
The Ministerial Advisory Committee must advise the Minister of Health regarding which Alert Level should be declared nationally, provincially, in a metropolitan area, or a district, when taking into account
(a) the epidemiological trends of Covid-19 infections;
(b) the health system capacity in a specified area to respond to the disease burden; and
(c) any other factor that would influence the level of infection, hospitalisation and mortality.
Epidemiological trends includes a consideration of the trends in the number of tests done, number of persons screened, number of positive cases, number of recoveries and the demographic profile of the positive cases.
Health system capacity includes a consideration of the number of facilities available to support Covid-19, bed-occupancy levels for the various levels of care, human resource capacity, equipment and related resources.

2021
New regulations governing who may attend a funeral under the Coronavirus-enforced lockdown have been put in place by the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta). 
Cogta Minister Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma has gazetted further amendments to the regulations on the COVID-19 lockdown in order to flatten the infection curve. 
The amendments allow certain individuals to move between provinces, metropolitan and district areas for the purposes of transporting a body for burial purposes. 
The amendment also limits the individuals who are permitted to travel to funerals. 
The regulations now outline a process on how people -- who wish to travel between provinces or metropolitan and district areas to attend a burial or cremation -- can obtain a permit. 
Only the following people, who live outside a province or metropolitan and district areas, may attend a funeral:
1.	spouse or partner of the deceased;
2.	children of the deceased, whether biological, adopted or stepchildren. 
3.	children-in-law of the deceased;
4.	parents of the deceased - whether biological, adopted or stepparents;
5.	siblings, whether biological, adopted or stepbrother or sister of the deceased;
6.	grandparents of the deceased; and
7.	persons closely affiliated to the deceased. 
 
The current prohibition of 50 persons attending a funeral is still in effect. The holding of night vigils is still prohibited. 
The permit may be obtained from a Magistrate or a station commander of a police station or a person designated by him or her. 
In order to obtain a permit a Magistrate, who is the head of office or a station commander of a police station or a person designated by him or her, must be provided with a death certificate or a certified copy of a death certificate. 
A permit holder may stay at a hotel, lodge or guesthouse for the duration of the funeral or cremation. The permit must be presented to the owner or manager of the hotel, lodge or guesthouse.
