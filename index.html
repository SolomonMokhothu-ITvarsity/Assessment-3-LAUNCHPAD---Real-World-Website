When it comes to funeral ceremonies, music plays a vital role. It is an important part of celebrating the life of a lost loved one. Healing music helps bereaved ones go through the grieving process. At Mphotleng Funeral Services music can be played from a CD, device (Phone or Ipod), or live music performances. These can be arranged for a service if you would like.

                        <li><a href="#">What is the purpose of  Embalming?<br/>
Embalming is an essential service undertaken by qualified professional embalmers. Without embalming, nature begins to take its course very soon after death. To enable family and friends to view and spend time with the deceased without unpleasantness and without risk to health, whatever the cause of death, we carry out this careful medical procedure unless a specific request is made by the family not to do so.<br/>
What should the deceased wear?<br/>
Before you would like to spend time with your loved one we will ask you to bring in clothing that you wish for them to wear. Casual or formal to suit the person concerned. 
Normally we would dress the person and place them in the casket. But if you wish to help in this process then you are more than welcome.
